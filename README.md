# Artifical-Intelligence-Project
This is a github repository following the journey of me and my friends into the vast world of artificial intelligence in Python. In this github we hope to store all the resources we use to learn and implement Machine Learning. This github is not only to highlight and keep our work organised but it is also to hopefully make learning AI and ML not as daunting of tasks as finding resources on AI can be very challenging. It can also make learning easier as we will have all the projects we do in this github so the reader will always have something to read and understand. Hopefully we will have a youtube channel to accompany these.
